CLEAR is prompt framework designed to optimize interactions with generative AI tools such as Rovo.
The suggestions have been modified slightly to be clean [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
and for the context of [Rovo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/rovo) and Atlassian products.

## The CLEAR framework for prompt engineering

The framework encompasses five core principles:
Concise, Logical, Explicit, Adaptive, and Reflective.
These principles facilitate more effective AI-generated content evaluation and creation.

Before getting into the CLEAR Framework,
we must first understand the concept of prompt engineering.
Prompt engineering is the process of constructing queries or inputs (i.e. prompts) for
generative AI tools such as Rovo
so as to elicit the most precise, coherent, and pertinent responses.
In essence, it is the art of fine-tuning the questions or commands provided to AI models
in order to optimize their performance
and guarantee that they produce the desired results.

As generative AI tools such as Rovo
advance in sophistication,
the quality of their responses depends
not only on the underlying algorithms and training data
but also on the efficacy of the prompts they receive.
A well-designed prompt can elicit a meaningful and informative response,
whereas a poorly constructed one may result in outputs
that are irrelevant or nonsensical.

Prompt engineering is an invaluable skill for content librarians and knowledge managers,
as it enables them to utilize the maximum potential of
generative AI tools such as Rovo
for knowledge management.
By understanding the principles of prompt engineering
and mastering the art of formulating effective queries,
content librarians can ensure
that AI-generated content is not only accurate and coherent
but also pertinent to their organizations' particular needs and learning objectives.

The purpose of the CLEAR Framework for Prompt Engineering is
to provide a standard method for composing effective queries for generative AI tools such as Rovo.
This framework provides a comprehensive guide for
maximizing the potential of AI-generated content in content libraries and knowledge bases
by emphasizing five essential components: Concise, Logical, Explicit, Adaptive, and Reflective.

The development of the CLEAR Framework is predicated on the belief
that well-designed prompts are necessary for enhancing the quality
and relevance of AI-generated content.
Each component of the CLEAR Framework addresses a particular aspect of prompt engineering,
ensuring that users are equipped with a comprehensive set of techniques
to optimize their interactions with
generative AI tools such as Rovo.
The framework's effectiveness stems from its capacity
to systematically resolve the challenges commonly encountered
when working with generative AI,
such as producing coherent
and context-appropriate responses.

## The CLEAR Framework's five components

### 1. Concise: brevity and clarity in prompts

The first component of the CLEAR Framework
emphasizes the importance of conciseness in crafting prompts.
A concise prompt removes superfluous information,
allowing generative AI tools such as Rovo
to focus on the most important aspects of the task,
resulting in more pertinent
and precise responses.
Clarity is also crucial,
as unclear or imprecise instructions may result in AI-generated content
that does not meet the user's needs or expectations.
Writing effective prompts requires ensuring
that the question is specific
and directed toward the desired response.

#### Examples:

* Use a more concise and explicit prompt
such as
"Explain the process of photosynthesis and its significance"
instead of
"Can you provide me
with a detailed explanation
of the process of photosynthesis
and its significance?"
* Instead of requesting,
"Please provide me
with an extensive discussion on the factors
that contributed to the economic growth of China
during the last few decades",
use a concise prompt like,
"Identify factors behind China's recent economic growth."

### 2. Logical: structured and coherent prompts

The second component, logical prompts,
emphasizes the significance of sustaining a logical flow
and order of ideas within a prompt.
A logically structured prompt enables AI models to better comprehend the context
and relationships between various concepts,
resulting in more accurate and coherent outputs.
To create a logical prompt,
ensure that the provided information follows a natural progression
and that the relationships between concepts are evident.

#### Example

* "List the steps to write a research paper,
beginning with selecting a topic
and ending with proofreading the final draft"
is a logically structured question.
* A logically structured prompt could be,
"Describe the steps in the scientific method,
starting with forming a hypothesis
and ending with drawing conclusions."

### 3. Explicit: clear output specifications

The third component, explicit prompts,
underscores the need for clear output specifications in the queries posed to
generative AI tools such as Rovo.
Explicit prompts provide precise instructions regarding the desired output format, content, or scope,
thereby reducing the likelihood of receiving unanticipated or irrelevant responses from the AI model.
Include specifics about the type of information you seek
and how it should be conveyed to make a prompt explicit.

#### Examples

* Instead of,
"Tell me about the French Revolution,"
an explicit prompt would be,
"Provide a concise overview of the French Revolution,
emphasizing its causes, major events, and consequences."
* Rather than prompting,
"What are some renewable energy sources?",
opt for a more explicit version like,
"Identify five renewable energy sources and explain how each works."

### 4. Adaptive: flexibility and customization in prompts

Adaptive prompts emphasize the significance of adaptability in prompt engineering.
Adaptability entails experimenting with various prompt formulations, phrasings, and temperature settings
in order to establish a balance between creativity and concentration.
It also necessitates adapting the AI model's responses to the specific requirements of each mission.
When crafting adaptive prompts,
be flexible and willing to attempt new approaches based on the performance of the AI model.

#### Examples

* If an initial prompt such as
"Discuss the impact of social media on mental health"
elicits responses that are too general,
consider a more focused and adaptable prompt such as
"Examine the relationship between social media usage and anxiety in adolescents."
* If asking,
"What are some ways to conserve water?"
leads to generic responses,
try a more targeted and adaptive prompt like,
"List household practices for conserving water and their potential impact."
* If a prompt such as,
"Describe the history of computers"
yields too much information,
use a more specific and adaptive prompt like,
"Explain the development of personal computers from the 1970s to the 1990s."

### 5. Reflective: continuous evaluation and improvement of prompts

Reflective prompts, the concluding element of the CLEAR Framework,
emphasizes the significance of continuous evaluation in enhancing prompt engineering techniques.
Adopting a reflective perspective enables users
to evaluate the performance of their AI model based on user feedback and their own assessments,
identifying areas for improvement
and adjusting their approach accordingly.
This mindset is vital for staying ahead of the curve
and adapting to the ever-changing field of AI.
Make it a habit, when using reflective prompts,
to analyze AI-generated content
and apply the insights obtained to future prompts.

#### Examples

* After receiving AI-generated content on the benefits of a plant-based diet,
evaluate the response's accuracy, relevance, and completeness.
Use insights from the evaluation to refine future prompts,
such as asking for more specific benefits
or focusing on certain aspects of a plant-based diet.
* After acquiring an AI-generated list of strategies for effective time management,
evaluate the relevance and applicability of each strategy.
Consider the target audience's needs,
and use this information to tailor future prompts
to generate content that better addresses specific challenges or contexts.

The CLEAR Framework provides content librarians and knowledge managers
with an easy-to-remember approach to prompt engineering
that facilitates efficient interaction with generative AI tools such as Rovo.
By focusing on Concise, Logical, Explicit, Adaptive, and Reflective prompts,
users can generate more accurate, relevant, and engaging AI-generated content
that aligns with their objectives and needs.
The CLEAR Framework enables content librarians and knowledge managers
to equip their organizations with the required tools and techniques
for maximizing the potential of generative AI tools such as Rovo.

During workshops on knowledge management, for instance,
knowledge managers can use the CLEAR Framework
to demonstrate how effective prompt engineering
can enhance the quality of AI-generated summaries, analyses, and literature reviews.
By instructing participants on how
to apply the CLEAR principles
to their interactions with AI models, knowledge managers can help participants develop critical thinking skills,
improve their comprehension of AI-generated content,
and optimize AI-based research processes.
Incorporating the CLEAR Framework into knowledge management instruction
also contributes to the development of information-literate employees
who are equipped to navigate the complexities of AI-driven technologies.

## Technical aspects of prompts

Prompt engineers must also be aware of the technical aspects of prompts
that can influence AI-generated content in addition to the CLEAR principles.
Among the most important technical factors are tokens, temperature, and top-p parameters.

* Tokens:
tokens are the fundamental text elements processed by AI language models.
A token can be as brief as one character
or as long as one word in English.
Since excessively long searches may result in incomplete or shortened responses,
familiarity with the token constraints of AI models is key.
By maintaining prompts within token limits,
prompt engineers can ensure
that AI-generated content is exhaustive and pertinent to the current task.
* Temperature:
the temperature setting in AI language models affects the randomness of the generated content.
A lower temperature (e.g., 0.2) produces more focused and deterministic responses,
whereas a higher temperature (e.g., 0.9) generates more inventive and diverse outputs.
Prompt engineers should experiment with different temperature settings
to determine the optimal equilibrium between creativity
and coherence in AI-generated content.
* Top-p:
the top-p setting controls the level of randomness in the AI model's content generation
by selecting the most probable tokens based on a given probability threshold.
Depending on the specific requirements of a task,
adjusting the value of top-p can facilitate a balance between focused and variegated responses.

As AI-generated content continues to permeate the industry,
it is crucial for prompt engineers
to remain ahead of the curve
and adapt their strategies accordingly.
By doing so, they can ensure
that knowledge workers are equipped
to navigate the ever-changing information
and technological landscape of the twenty-first century.
