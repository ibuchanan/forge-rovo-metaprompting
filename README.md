[Meta Prompting](https://github.com/suzgunmirac/meta-prompting)
is a strategy to create prompts interactively,
using a large language model (LLM) to guide the process.
This repo is a collection of guides, frameworks, and agent instructions as meta prompts.
The goal is to help layman prompt engineers be more effective at creating prompts and building agents.
While the focus is on Rovo Agents, Forge, and Atlassian products,
the principles and methods can be applied to other AI systems.
